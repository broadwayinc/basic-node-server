<h1>Basic Node Server</h1>

<p>
    Basic node server for everyone.
    <br>
    Basic node server simply hosts and serves files from the current project directory through HTTP.
    <br>
    If no path is given, it will serve the index.html file.
</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<pre>
node bns [port] [404 file]
</pre>
<p>
    The [port] argument is optional. If no port is given, it will default to 3000.
    <br>
    For example, if you want to serve the current directory on port 8080, you would run:
</p>
<pre>
node bns 8080
</pre>
<p>
    The [404 file] argument is optional. If file location is given, it will respond the file on 404.
    <br>
    For example, if you want your 404 page to be 404.html on port 8080, you would run:
</p>
<pre>
node bns 8080 404.html
</pre>
<h2>NPM</h2>
<pre>
npm install basic-node-server
</pre>
<p>
    Then, you can run it from your project directory:
</p>
<pre>
npx bns [port] [404 file]
</pre>
